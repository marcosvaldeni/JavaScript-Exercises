# JavaScript Exercises

A hobby of making videos for youtube, becoming a challenge to learn and teach. 
Following the third cycle of learning (learn, exercise and teach), I will make a list of exercise, 
where I am going to explaining certain points of the JavaScript language.

# :clipboard: List
**1ยบ** Write a function that takes two values, A and B as arguments. Return true if the values are the same and the same type.

**2ยบ** Write a function that takes a number as an argument. If the number is even, return true if not false.

**3ยบ** Write a function that takes two values, A and B as arguments. If A is smaller than B, divide A by B. Otherwise, multiply both numbers and return the result.

**4ยบ** Write a function that takes a value as an argument. If the value is an integer (has no decimal place), return true, otherwise, return false.

**5ยบ** Write a function that takes two strings, A and B as arguments. If A contains B, concatenate B at the beginning of A, if not, concatenate B at the end of A. Finally, return to the concatenation.

**6ยบ** Write a function that takes an object with the properties number and percentage as an argument, return the given percentage of the number.

**7ยบ** Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments, X and Y. Check if X is divisible by Y, if yes, returns X. Otherwise, return the next natural number divisible by Y.

**8ยบ** Write a function that takes a number as an argument, that function must separate the characters from the number into elements and return an array of numbers.

**9ยบ** Write a function that takes a string as an argument, that function must replace each letter of the string with the next in the alphabet and return the new word.

**10ยบ** Write a function that takes two strings as arguments, that function must concatenate what was received, clean up the strange characters (removes the %) and return a word with the first letter capitalized.

**11ยบ** Write a function that takes a number as an argument, that function should return this number rounded to two digits after the comma.

**12ยบ** Write a function to find the area of a triangle. This function must receive three numerical values, each value represents one side of the triangle.

**13ยบ** Write a function that takes a number as an argument and returns it's factorials.
