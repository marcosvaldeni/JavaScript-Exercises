# JavaScript Exercises

A hobby of making videos for youtube, becoming a challenge to learn and teach. 
Following the third cycle of learning (learn, exercise and teach), I will make a list of exercise, 
where I am going to explaining certain points of the JavaScript language.

# :clipboard: List
**1º** Write a function that takes two values, A and B as arguments. Return true if the values are the same and the same type.

**2º** Write a function that takes a number as an argument. If the number is even, return true if not false.

**3º** Write a function that takes two values, A and B as arguments. If A is smaller than B, divide A by B. Otherwise, multiply both numbers and return the result.

**4º** Write a function that takes a value as an argument. If the value is an integer (has no decimal place), return true, otherwise, return false.
